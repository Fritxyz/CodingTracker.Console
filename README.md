# Coding Tracker

Coding Tracker is a console application built with C# (.NET 8) that allows users to track and manage coding sessions. The application uses SQLite for data storage and Dapper for data access, while Spectre.Console is used for creating a visually appealing command-line interface.

## Technologies Used

- **C#**: Programming language used to build the application.
- **.NET 8**: Framework for developing the console application.
- **SQLite**: Database used for storing coding session data.
- **Dapper**: ORM for data access and manipulation.
- **Spectre.Console**: Library for creating rich console applications.

## Features

- **View All Data**: Display all coding sessions with start time, end time, and duration.
- **Insert New Data**: Add new coding sessions with specified start time, end time, and duration.
- **Delete Data**: Remove existing coding sessions by ID.
- **Update Data**: Modify existing coding sessions.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/coding-tracker.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**

   ```bash
   cd coding-tracker
   ```

3. **Restore Dependencies**

   Ensure you have .NET 8 SDK installed. Restore the project dependencies using:

   ```bash
   dotnet restore
   ```

4. **Create the Database**

   The application automatically creates the necessary tables in the SQLite database when it runs. Ensure that `config.json` is correctly set up with the appropriate connection string.

## Usage

1. **Run the Application**

   ```bash
   dotnet run
   ```

2. **Main Menu**

   The application presents the following options:

   - **0**: Close the application
   - **1**: View all data
   - **2**: Insert new data
   - **3**: Delete data
   - **4**: Update data

   Follow the prompts to interact with the application.

## Code Overview

- **`Program.cs`**: Entry point of the application. Contains the main menu and handles user input.
- **`CodingSession.cs`**: Model representing a coding session.
- **`CodingTrackerCrud.cs`**: Provides CRUD operations for the coding session data.
- **`CodingTracker.cs`**: Contains business logic and handles user choices.
- **`DataAccessLayer.cs`**: Manages database operations using Dapper.
- **`Helpers.cs`**: Contains helper methods for user input and validation.
- **`Validations.cs`**: Contains validation logic for date and time inputs.

## Configuration

The application expects a `config.json` file in the root directory for the SQLite connection string. The file should be structured as follows:

```json
{
  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "Default": "Data Source=codingtracker.db"
  }
}
```
